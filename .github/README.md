EzChestShopReborn is a fork from the [EzChestShop](https://github.com/ItzAmirreza/EzChestShop) plugin originally authored by [ItzAmirreza](https://github.com/ItzAmirreza).

This fork was created to support Minecraft 1.21, on request from the [Torrent SMP](https://www.torrentsmp.com/) server.

As of October 27th 2024 the original EzChestShop plugin is no longer actively maintained and offers no support for Minecraft versions beyond 1.20.4.
